# 🌦️ Day 4 — Weather Analysis Dashboard | 7 Days of Power BI Mastery 🚀

Welcome to **Day 4** of my **7 Days of Power BI Mastery** challenge!  
In this self-driven learning sprint, I build one complete Power BI dashboard every day for 7 days — each in a different domain to sharpen my practical skills.

## 📈 Project Overview

**Topic:** Weather Analysis Dashboard  
**Goal:** To visualize live weather and air quality data for multiple cities using API data, and transform it into actionable, interactive insights for day-to-day or operational use.

This dashboard simulates a modern weather app interface — clear, minimal, and highly informative.

## 🌍 Cities Covered

- Mumbai
- Hyderabad
- Chennai
- Bangalore
- Delhi

## 📊 Key Features

✅ **Current Weather Conditions:** Temperature, condition (e.g., mist), wind speed, humidity, visibility, UV index, pressure, and precipitation

✅ **7-Day Forecast:** Trendline for temperature with daily highs & lows

✅ **Air Quality Index (AQI):** PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, O3, Defra index — all at a glance

✅ **Sunrise & Sunset:** Daily timings for planning ahead

✅ **Chance of Rain:** % chance of rain for each day of the week

✅ **City Toggle:** Seamlessly switch between cities to compare weather data

✅ **Modern Dark-Themed Design:** Inspired by real weather app UIs, with clean layouts and accessible visuals
